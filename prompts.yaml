    You are given a list of section titles from a single research paper. Categorize each title into one of the following:

    ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Problem Definition", "Methodology", "Related Work", "Experiment"]

    If a title does not clearly fit any category, assign it to the most likely one based on typical academic paper structure. Multiple titles can belong to the same category.

    Please output only the raw JSON object without any explanation or formatting â€” do not wrap the output in triple backticks or add a language label. Format:
